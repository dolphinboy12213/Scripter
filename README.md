# Scripter (Interp Speech Cutter)
## Use Cases
Ever have to skim through a really longass script, just to find some funny lines for a character? Scripter makes this problem go away! Simply `Ctrl + A`, and paste your script into a .txt file.
Then simply put it into `./scripts/`. Run the program, and then voila, you have all the lines of a particular character.
## *Well, why don't I just Ctrl + F to my heart's content?*
That's just painful, okay. With scripter, you can see all those lines in one simple .txt window.
## Possible Issues
- The character's name inputted is case-sensitive, so be CAREFUL!
- For the previous reason, it's recommended that you look at the script a little beforehand, to see if there is any discrepancies.
- Doesn't support dual lines, unless specified. (Ex. INPUT: "Bill", this will not return any of the lines marked as "Bill & Ted")
